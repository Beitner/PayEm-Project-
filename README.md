# Payem-Project


At PayEm, we developed a machine learning model, to predict expense approval from user transactions, which includes:
- Tabular Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering/ Feature Extraction
- Imbalanced Data
- Statistical Model Selection
- Model Fine Tuning and Optimization
- Model Dockerizing and Deployment 
- Application of NLP techniques for text features engineering: unsupervised topic modeling from short texts using BERT, text clustering.
The model is being integrated into PayEm production to bring in machine learning into clients approval flows.

Experience with tools:
-Git, Docker, FastAPI, AWS.
